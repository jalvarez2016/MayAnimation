Welcome to my May Animation! (Mothers Day Themed)

## About

<p>
  This project was made using Remotion for the purposes of avoiding having to pay a
  monthly subscription to adobe just to add audio to my animations. At the moment, 
  I'm currently learning how remotion works so I'll be making a new repo for every months work.
  Eventually, once I have more time and know more about how remotion works, I'll work on adding 
  a more reusable and cohesive flow where I can just add the new animations and music instead 
  of making new repos. Below are the commands to run remotion and preview it in browser.
